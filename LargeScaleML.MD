## Data 

### Data Ingestion 
Streaming ingestion involves: 
* **Clickstream** : an ordered series of interactions that users have with some interface. 
* **Change data capture**: process of recording changes within a databade system. 
* **Live video**

**Clickstream tools**

KAFKA 
* Open source software platform which provides a way to handle real-time data streaming. 
* If clickstream logs come at a faster pace than the broker can handle you need more brokers.

AMAZON KINESIS 
* AWS alternative to kafka 
* With Amazon Kinesis, you can ingest real-time data such as video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data for machine learning, analytics, and other applications.
* Data is sent from producers to shards and from them to the consumers. 
* How to ingest data is called 'change data capture'
