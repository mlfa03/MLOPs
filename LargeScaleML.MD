# Large Scale Machine Learning

## Data 

### Data Ingestion 
Streaming ingestion involves: 
* **Clickstream** : an ordered series of interactions that users have with some interface. 
* **Change data capture**: process of recording changes within a databade system. 
* **Live video**

**Clickstream tools**

KAFKA 
* Open source software platform which provides a way to handle real-time data streaming. 
* If clickstream logs come at a faster pace than the broker can handle you need more brokers.
