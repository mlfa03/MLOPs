## Terraform 

### What is it?

* Terraform is an infrastructure management tool made by HashiCorp that lets you provision, manage and maintain Cloud resources, like servers, 
networking, storage, et cetera, all in one centralized set of code.
* It is a tool, command line program you run to define and make changes to your infrastructure. 
* It is also a language that defines those changes. Terraform is for managing the base infrastructure itself.

### Terraform and containers 

* Terraform can work directly with Docker and Kubernetes offering a couple of approaches for container-based workload. 
* Kubernetes could also be paired with Amazon's Kubernetes support or through another cloud provider. 
* You could even use Terraform to provision a Kubernetes cluster on a Cloud provider. And then use the Terraform Kubernetes provider to 
provision containers on that cluster.
