### Glossary 
* **Cluster** : a consolidated group of points 
* **Euclidean Distance**: the length of the line between two points. 
* **Feature normalization**: typically referring to feature scaling that places the values of a feature between 0 and 1. 
* **Feature Standardization**: referring to feature scaling that centers the values of a feature around the mean of the features and scales by the standard deviation of the feature
* **Jaccard distance**: one minus the ratio of the number of like binary feature values and the number of like and unlike binary feature values, excluding instances of matching zeros. 
* **Simple matching distance**: one minus the ratio of the number of like binary feature values and the number of like and unlike binary feature values. 
* **Manhattan distance**: sum of the absolute differences of two input features. 
* **Hamming distance**: sum of the non matching categorical feature values.
