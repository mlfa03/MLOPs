**[back to index](https://github.com/mlfa03/MLOPs/blob/main/README.md)**

### Main concepts 
Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often used in machine learning applications to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted and actual outputs. It's an inexact but powerful technique. Stochastic gradient descent is widely used in machine learning applications.
