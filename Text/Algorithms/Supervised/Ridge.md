## Ridge Regression

### Main concepts

Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization. When the issue of multicollinearity occurs, least-squares are unbiased, and variances are large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values.

Ridge Regression is an adaptation of the widely used linear regression algorithm. It enhances regular linear regression by slightly changing its cost function, which results in less overfit models.
