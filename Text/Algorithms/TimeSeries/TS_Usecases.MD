## Time Series Use Cases 

### Uber 

When the underlying mechanisms are not known or are too complicated, e.g., the stock market, or not fully known, e.g., retail sales, it is usually better to apply a simple statistical model. Popular classical methods that belong to this category include ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average), exponential smoothing methods, such as Holt-Winters, and the Theta method, which is less widely used, but performs very well. In fact, the Theta method won the M3 Forecasting Competition, and we also have found it to work well on Uberâ€™s time series (moreover, it is computationally cheap).
