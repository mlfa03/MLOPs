## Exponential Trend Method 

### Use cases 
* Method for forecasting univariate time series data. 

### Method 
* Based on the principle that a prediction is a weighted linear sum of past observations or lags. 
* The Exponential Smoothing time series method works by assigning exponentially decreasing weights for past observations.

Types of exponential smoothing:
* Single ES 
* Double ES : adds support for trends in the univariate time series.
* Triple ES: adds support for seasonality to the univariate time series.  (Holt-Winters)
