# Collaborative and Content Filtering 

## Glossary

* **Content filtering**: technique which takes into account a single user's features and many item's features. 
* **Collaborative filtering**: techinique which uses many user's and item's data typically in the form of a user-item matrix
* **User-item matrix**: a matrix which contains the interactions of users and items
* **Inverse user frequency**: added modelling assumption that if a user interacts with a less overall popular item, then the interaction should count for more. 
* **Time decay**: added modelling assumption that interactions between items and users should count for less overtime. 
* **Matrix factorization**: factors the user-item matrix into embeddings such that multiplying together the resulting embedding layers gives an estimate for the original user-item matrix.
* **Echo chamger**: a state of recommendation system in which user behaviour is reinforced by the recommendations themselves. 
* **Shilling attack**: a type of attack on a recommendation system in which users manipulate the recommendations by inflating or deflating positive interactions for their own or competing items.
