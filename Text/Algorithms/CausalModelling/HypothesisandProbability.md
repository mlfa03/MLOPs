**Null Hypothesis**
The null hypothesis is basically the deny or we can the negation of our whole hypothesis. 
The null hypothesis is trying to say that there is no statistical relationship or no significance exist in our observed variable. 
Which means there is no such case that exists where our whole claim is true. The Null Hypothesis is denoted by H0 .  null hypothesis should be in such a way that if we design an experiment for hypothesis testing, it is easy to experiment with the null hypothesis and easily get the result.


**Alternative Hypothesis**
The alternative Hypothesis is exactly the opposite of our null hypothesis. the alternative hypothesis is our actual claim which we trying to find out with the help of statical relationships. there can be multiple alternative hypotheses that can exist. the alternative hypothesis is denoted by H1 or Ha.

#### Steps to Hypothesis Testing

1. Defining two mutually exclusive statements.

So in the first step we convert our claim or our assumption into two mutually exclusive statements. 
This is the step where we should define our Null hypothesis and Alternate hypothesis so that we further evaluate these hypotheses.

2. Designing the test and test statistics for hypothesis testing.

We will define that what is our test should be and what are the variables we are going to use in this test. 
The test must be easy and accurate to perform because this is the main pillar of our hypothesis testing.

3. Performing our designed test and finding the probability value for our test statistics.
We perform our designed test, in this step we calculate the probability of our test with respect to our null hypothesis. 
The probability **P** of our experiment is called **significance value**, *the significance value should be greater or equal than 5% in most cases* but, in a special situation like the medical domain, the domain experts can decide the value of significance for minimizing the risk.
**p value** : can help determine whether patterns in our data are extreme or fluctuate no more than we would expect from sampling variation. 
It is the probability under a specified statistical model that a statistical summary of the data would be equal to or more extreme than its observed value.

4. Reject or select the Null Hypothesis based on the result of the third step.
In this step we will decide, that either we select our Null Hypothesis and reject our Alternative hypothesis or we reject our Null hypothesis and select an Alternative hypothesis. 
We should select or reject the hypothesis according to our significance value which we calculated in the above step.
