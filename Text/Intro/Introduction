# Introduction 

The aim of this is to summarize information that is fundamental for someone working with MLOPs. We will start from the fundamentals of Machine Learning 
algorithms, passing by deployment methods and monitoring. Specific chapters dedicated to the infrastructure necessary for putting models available to
the user and scaling them will also be addressed, such as Docker, Kubernetes etc.
