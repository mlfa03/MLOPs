## Bayesian Statistics 

Bayesian statistics is a particular approach to applying probability to statistical problems. It provides us with mathematical tools to update our beliefs about random events in light of seeing new data or evidence about those events.

**Bayesian x Frequentist statistics**
Bayesian statistics provides us with mathematical tools to rationally update our subjective beliefs in light of new data or evidence.
Frequentist statistics assumes that probabilities are the long-run frequency of random events in repeated trials.
Frequentist statistics tries to eliminate uncertainty by providing estimates. Bayesian statistics tries to preserve and refine uncertainty by adjusting individual beliefs in light of new evidence.

Bayesian probability represents uncertainty while frequentist probability represents relative frequency.

* **Posterior probability** (updated probability after the evidence is considered)
* **Prior probability** (the probability before the evidence is considered)
* **Likelihood** (probability of the evidence, given the belief is true)
* **Marginal probability** (probability of the evidence, under any circumstance)
